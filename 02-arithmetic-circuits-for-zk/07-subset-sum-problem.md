# Subset sum problem

## Problem

Create an arithmetic circuit that models the [Subset sum problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem). Given a set of integers (assume they are all non-negative), determine if there is a subset that sums to a given value k. For example, given the set $\{3,5,17,21\}$ and $k = 22$, there is a subset $\{5,17\}$ that sums to $22$. Of course, a subset sum problem does not necessarily have a solution.

## Solution

$x_1^2 \equiv x_1$

$x_2^2 \equiv x_2$

$...$

$x_n^2 \equiv x_n$

$k \equiv a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + ... + a_nx_n$
